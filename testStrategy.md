‚úÖ Test Strategy for New Login Page
1. Objectives
Verify the login functionality works as expected.
Ensure secure authentication and data handling.
Validate user experience across devices and browsers.
Identify and eliminate any potential security vulnerabilities.

2. Scope
In Scope:
UI and UX of the login page.
Functionality (email/password input, login button, password visibility toggle).
Validation (empty fields, invalid credentials, format checks).
Security (encryption, rate-limiting, error messages).
Compatibility across major browsers and devices.

Out of Scope:
Backend systems not directly related to authentication (e.g., dashboards, post-login flows).

3. Test Types & Coverage
Test Type	Description
Functional Testing	Verify that login works with valid credentials, fails with invalid ones.
UI/UX Testing	Ensure form layout, spacing, responsiveness, accessibility, etc.
Input Validation	Check email format, password requirements, required fields.
Error Handling	Ensure appropriate error messages for invalid input, failed login, etc.
Security Testing	Check for SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, HTTPS enforcement, brute-force protection.
Compatibility Testing	Cross-browser and cross-device testing.
Performance Testing	Login response time under load.
Accessibility Testing	Use screen readers, tab orders, color contrast, ARIA labels.
Localization Testing	If applicable, test different languages/locales.

4. Test Scenarios (Examples)
‚úÖ Login with valid credentials.
‚ùå Login with incorrect email/password.
‚õî Attempt login with empty fields.
‚úâÔ∏è Email field validation (invalid formats, required field).
üîê Password visibility toggle works correctly.
üîÑ Remember Me option functionality (if available).
‚ö†Ô∏è Error message displays and disappears as expected.
üîí Login over HTTPS only.
üß† Prevent brute force (account lockout or CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts).
üîÑ Session timeout and logout behavior.
üîÑ API response validation (status codes, error formats).

5. Test Data
Scenario	Test Data
Valid Login	testuser@example.com / CorrectPassword123
Invalid Email Format	user@@example, user@.com, userexample.com
Empty Fields	'', '', or partially filled
SQL Injection Attempt	' OR '1'='1
XSS Attempt	<script>alert('XSS')</script>

6. Environments
Staging/Test Environment: Mirror production setup.
Devices: Desktop, tablet, mobile.
Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions).

7. Tools
Automation: Cypress
API Testing: Postman
Security Testing: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
Accessibility: Axe, Lighthouse, NVDA.
Performance: JMeter, Chrome DevTools.

8. Roles & Responsibilities
Role	Responsibility
QA Engineer	Write/execute test cases, report bugs.
Developer	Fix defects, support in root cause analysis.
Product Owner	Confirm requirements, validate UI/UX changes.

9. Risks and Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Credentials exposed in logs	Mask sensitive data in logs.
Session hijacking	Use secure, HTTP-only cookies.
Incomplete error handling	Add detailed logs and UI feedback.

10. Exit Criteria
100% functional test cases passed.
No open critical or high-priority bugs.
Accessibility and security scans pass thresholds.
Stakeholder sign-off received.
